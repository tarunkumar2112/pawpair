## What is PawPair?

PawPair is an Airbnb-style marketplace built specifically for dog care. Instead of manual browsing, PawPair runs a **5-dimension compatibility algorithm** that matches dogs to caregivers based on size, temperament, location, energy level, and experience — giving every match a score and a compatibility tier (High / Medium / Low).

                    accepts_temperaments[] · services[] · certifications
                    city · zip_code · availability · is_approved · created_at
matches             id · dog_id · caregiver_id
                    location_score · size_score · temperament_score
                    availability_score · experience_score
                    total_score (GENERATED) · compatibility_tier (GENERATED)
                    match_status · created_at
                    UNIQUE (dog_id, caregiver_id)
```

Row Level Security is enabled on all tables. Owners manage their dogs, caregivers manage their profiles, and matches are visible only to the relevant owner and caregiver.

## Matching Algorithm

Each caregiver is scored 0–5 across 5 dimensions:

| Dimension | Logic |
|---|---|
| **Location** | City name match = 5, else 2 |
| **Size** | Caregiver accepts dog's size = 5, else 0 |
| **Temperament** | Overlap ratio × 5 (rounded) |
| **Availability** | Schedule overlap = 5, partial = 3, else 1 |
| **Experience** | ≥5 yrs = 5 · ≥3 yrs = 4 · ≥1 yr = 3 · <1 yr = 1 |

**Total score** = sum of all 5 dimensions (max 25)

| Tier | Score |
|---|---|
| 🟡 High | ≥ 18 |
| 🔵 Medium | 10–17 |
| ⚪ Low | < 10 |
